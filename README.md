# Shipping & Logistic Microservices Application

A full-fledged **Shipping & Logistic System** built with **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **H2**, **Redis**, and **MERN stack integration for frontend**. This project demonstrates **event-driven architecture**, **microservices**, and real-time logistics management.

## üèó Project Structure / Microservices

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Order Service** | Create, update, and track orders. Publishes order events. |
| **Inventory Service** | Checks stock, reserves items, and publishes inventory events. |
| **Shipment Service** | Creates shipments, assigns drivers/vehicles, updates shipment status. Publishes shipment events. |
| **Transport Service** | Assigns vehicles and drivers (optional separate from Shipment Service). |
| **Tracking Service** | Updates shipment progress and notifies customers. |
| **Notification Service** | Sends emails or messages on order/shipment status. |
| **API Gateway** | Routes requests to respective services. |
| **Service Registry (Eureka)** | Manages microservice discovery and registration. |
| **Zipkin (Distributed Tracing)** | Tracks requests across microservices and visualizes end-to-end flow. |
